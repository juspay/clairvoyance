"""Attributed-event reads — owned by the record module, consumed by the
outreach walker (the goal re-check at fire time).

Trivial today — one query, one decode, no decisions — but contracts.py
re-exports from here rather than db/accessor directly (the timeline.py
seam): cross-module callers never depend on a mechanical accessor
signature.
